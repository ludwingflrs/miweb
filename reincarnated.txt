- My present life is Kendrick Lamar
A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe
The only factor I respected was raisin' the bar
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment
I close my eyes, hoping that I don't come off contentious
I'm yelling, "Father, did I finally get it right?" Everything I did was selfless
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
I didn't gloat, even told 'em, "No," when the vultures came
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed

> Son, you do well, but your heart is closed
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself

- Father, I'm not perfect, I got urges, but I hold them down

> "But your pride has to die"

- okay, Father, show me how

> Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for

- I kept one hundred institutions paid

> Okay, tell me more

- I put one hundred hoods on one stage

> Okay, tell me more

- I'm tryna push peace in L.A. 

> But you love war

- No, I don't

> Oh, yes, you do

- Okay, then tell me the truth

> Every individual is only a version of you
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?

- I could tell you where I'm going

> I could tell you who you are
You fell out of Heaven 'cause you was anxious
Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous
Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent
My greatest music director was you
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
It was harmony and motion
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
Rehabilitation, not psychosis
But now we here now
Centuries you manipulated man with music
Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving
You came a long way from garnishing evilish views.

- And all I ever wanted from you was love and approval
I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
I'm using words for inspiration as an idea

> So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?

- I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding

> For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?

- I vow my life just to live one in harmony now

> You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity

- And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy

> Then let's rejoice where we at

- I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated
